Resistance can be inherent or be acquired by chromosomal changes or DNA transfer via plasmids and transposons. The emerging antimicrobial resistances have produced therapeutic crisis while the overuse of antibiotics has fueled this crisis. \r\n\r\nS. aureus is a member of the Firmicutes that causes skin infections such as abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Any strain of S. aureus that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as methicillin is called MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The emergence of MRSA has been a public health problem worldwide now. [Vancomycin is usually prescribed to treat MRSA infection, this means MRSA is not invincible. Nevertheless, the resistance does make MRSA infection more difficult to treat.]As large numbers of antibiotics synthesized over the past three decades are now facing challenges, the development of novel antibiotics has been an urgent need. Our iGEM team sets a goal to tackle this problem by a new way using synthetic biology instead of conventional antibiotic therapies. \r\n\r\nEarly at the beginning of 20th century, bacteriophage was discovered and then used to treat bacterial infections. But the research of phage therapy discontinued with the advent of antibiotics. Now phage comes back. Scientists restudy phage therapy due to the worldwide antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage treatment offers a possible alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments for bacterial infection. However, too many problems exist in the utilization of nature phage, such as ecological risk brought by transduction and lysogenic conversion, bacterial biofilm obstacle, and the narrow host spectrum. So we engineered and used phages; that is to say, we constructed genetically modified phages, able to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, to work for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Body**\r\nI'm a handsome phage with a super \"mind\" and a weird \"envelope\"---and a \"gun\".\r\n\r\n>**Core  [key word: SOS]**\r\n\r\n>DNA damage induces the SOS response, which results in DNA repair. We engineered bacteriophage with lexA3 gene to over-express a protein, which has been demonstrated to repress the SOS DNA Repair System and thus inhibit the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Our engineered phage acts as a strong adjuvant for other bactericidal antibiotics.\r\n\r\n>**Capsule  [key word: Delivery]**\r\n\r\n>PLGA, poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid, is one of the most effective biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) due to its biocompatibility with tissue and cells, controlled and sustained- release properties and low toxicity. The use of PLGA-based nanoparticles in drug delivery improves the circulation time of the conjugated or encapsulated drug. \r\nA few trials have indicated that the patient's immune system can, in some cases, mount an immune response to the phage. A PLGA-based capsule also helps with immunologic escaping.\r\n\r\n>**Accessory  [key word: Biofilm]** \r\n\r\n>A biofilm is any group of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often these cells adhere to a surface. These adherent cells are frequently embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body. \r\n \r\n>The EPS provides mechanical support and acts as protective environment. A beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (DspB) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans CU1000 has proved effective to degrade the poly-β(1,6)-N-acetyl-glucosamine (PNAG), which is the major polysaccharide in EPS of Staphylococcus aureus. DspB enzyme can destroy the EPS and remove the biofilm, so Bacteriophages over-expressing DspB are more powerful weapons against bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Download our page's codes,find the \"posts\" and then you can get the whole report.**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
