Background
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century, but their efficacy is now continuously challenged by the emergence of antimicrobial resistances. Resistance can be inherent or be acquired by chromosomal changes or DNA transfer via plasmids and transposons. The emerging antimicrobial resistances have produced therapeutic crisis while the overuse of antibiotics has fueled this crisis. 
S. aureus is a member of the Firmicutes that causes skin infections such as abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Any strain of S. aureus that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as methicillin is called MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The emergence of MRSA has been a public health problem worldwide now. [Vancomycin is usually prescribed to treat MRSA infection, this means MRSA is not invincible. Nevertheless, the resistance does make MRSA infection more difficult to treat.]As large numbers of antibiotics synthesized over the past three decades are now facing challenges, the development of novel antibiotics has been an urgent need. Our iGEM team sets a goal to tackle this problem by a new way using synthetic biology instead of conventional antibiotic therapies.
