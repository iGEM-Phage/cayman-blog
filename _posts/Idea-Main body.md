Idea-1 
>Main body  [key word: Bacteriophage]
>>Early at the beginning of 20th century, bacteriophage was discovered and then used to treat bacterial infections. But the research of phage therapy discontinued with the advent of antibiotics. Now phage comes back. Scientists restudy phage therapy due to the worldwide antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage treatment offers a possible alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments for bacterial infection. However, too many problems exist in the utilization of nature phage, such as ecological risk brought by transduction and lysogenic conversion, bacterial biofilm obstacle, and the narrow host spectrum. So we engineered and used phages; that is to say, we constructed genetically modified phages, able to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, to work for us.
